### Business Problem

Amazon, as a global e-commerce leader, deals with massive and complex datasets across multiple regions, product lines, and customer segments. Raw data from sales, shipments, and customer transactions are often fragmented, making it difficult for decision-makers to quickly identify trends, recognize underperforming areas, and spot growth opportunities. The business needed a consolidated, visual tool to provide real-time insights into high-impact areas such as product profitability, market-specific performance, and customer trends.

### Goal of the Dashboard

The main goal of this dashboard is to centralize and visualize critical sales and operational metrics from Amazon‚Äôs vast store of data. By transforming messy datasets into easily understandable visuals, the dashboard empowers business leaders and analysts to:

‚Ä¢ Track sales, profits, and product performance across time and geographies.

‚Ä¢ Identify top-performing products and customers, as well as underperforming areas.

‚Ä¢ Monitor shipment and delivery timelines.

‚Ä¢ Make data-driven decisions faster, improving overall business agility.
